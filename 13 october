# Difference between = and == operator
The '=' is a simple assignment operator. It assigns values from right side operands to the left side operand
While on the other hand '==' checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.
ex: a=10, #The value 10 will be stored in the integer variable a
(a==10): #This checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.

#. What does the ** operator do in Python, What does the ** operator do in Python
ex: 3**3 - 27

#. What does the ^ operator do in Python
 IT is a bitwise XOR operator,  It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of two numbers.
It will take binary values and execute XOR operation
x=3
y=5

Task 2
#  Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula
area=π×r^2 ( Take pi as 3.14)
radius= float(input(Enter the value of radius \n*)
Area of circle= 3.14(radius**2)
print(Area of circle)

# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number
a= int(input("Enter first number: \n"))
b= int(input("Enter third number:"))

if a>b Print("a is greater than b")
elif a<b print("a is less than b")
else a=b Print("a is equal to b")

# ternary operator
a= int(input("First number entered by user\n"))
b= int(input("Second number entered by user \n"))
c= int(input("Third number entered by user \n"))
max_value = (a if a>b and a>c else b if b>c else c)
print(max_value)

# square and cube of a given number
a= int(input("Enter value of a "\n))
square= (a**2)
cube=(a**3)
print("Square)
print("cube)
