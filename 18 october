# Fibinocci series
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.It typically
# starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
# ex: n! = 1*2*3*......(n-1)*n
n = int(input("Enter the range: "))
a := 0, b := 1,
print(a)
print(b)
# for in range(0,number):
if (num <= 1):
    next = num
else:
    next number = num1 + num2
    num1 = num2
    num2 = next
    print(next)
# Factorial
a = int(input("Enter the number"))
b=1
while a != 0:
    b = a *b
    a = a - 1
print(b)

Task2
Example using break to exit a loop when i == 51 while printing the values from 1 to 100
factorial of a non-negative integer n denoted by n!Product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
ex:{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}
for i in range(1,101):
    print(i,end=" ")
    if i==51:
        break
print("\n")
print("Loop stoped at given condition")
